These algorithms were designed to create continuous wavelt transform spectrograms from locomotor activity data collected from mice or rats. Specifically they use the morlet wavelet as we have found this to be the ideal candidate for detecting cycle to cycle variations in our noisy datasets.  They deal specifically with rhythms in the hourly range (from ~1hr to 1day) and are designed to allow for a baseline recording followed immediately by a treatment of some kind (drug, food access, schedule change, etc.
